why deactivate facebook?

> not because of messenger
> communication with everyone (transparency of everyone)

>> trust/honesty to compensate inequalities
>> equality, meritocratic

representation is not a solution to a representational problem.

learn to code
>> lower the wages
>> power tripping

learn to code as learning to read

learning how facebook works > making less money for facebook

does facebook work for the long-term? hard to predict the long-term

no one predicted fake news…? endorsed by friends, want to believe

social networks based historically on face-to-face relationships
weak ties >> fake news are being broadcast
strong ties >> allegiance


more freedom in anonymity
identity (4chan) and image (fb)

the will to synchronize it only exists when designed. if their is no nudge towards what we’ve missed, there is no desire to spend more time on that platform.
