> describe your system in as much detail as you can by drawing it as a diagram

>> what is the state of your system (e.g. emotional interaction, headlines written, amount of google owned)?

>> what are the inflows and outflows (money, humans, body language)? what are the feedback loops? what is encouraging positive behavior? what is discouraging negative behavior?

>> can you identify your leverage points?

>> are those leverage points physical (e.g. changing headlines or using CPU cycles) or informational (representing existing data in a different way)?
