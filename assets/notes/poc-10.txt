“hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner”


WORK IN THE PAST
- people need money (to survive / to live comfortably / to get, therefore to buy things they cannot produce / to acquire certain position in society)

- surviving is work (hunting or cultivating the land)
- consumption of resources (taking things that are there)

- alienation

- protestantism

- work is what you do for fun but a job isn’t
- greek democracy (no job is the best position > job is done by slaves and foreigners)

- confliction between creation and alienation


WORK IN THE PRESENT
- crowdsourcing > no constraint
- no repetition but a sense gratification not as much effort as real job
- you own it, not a mutually-exclusive product


> lack of constraint
> ownership
> creation of objects


the internet and the rise of platforms
- centralized entity that connects anyone to anyone

- centralized entity that provides services between consumer and suppliers
- marketplace
- leverage the network effect: the monopoly (change in language)

increase of control 

the sharing economy
- create new values in resources that are already there and underutilized (uber, airbnb)
- consumer’s perspective vs. driver’s perspective
- people do it full time
- not a level-playing field at 


> lack of constraint
> ownership
> creation of objects
>>>> create further inequality

WORK IN THE FUTURE

jobs in the gig economy:
- part-time > social status
- full-time > money & purpose

robot versus human: amount of pay / conditions of labor

we can replace with robots if you don’t end up unemployed (money vs. social status vs. internal goals)
efficiency

— automation > will switch to human interaction (long-term)
- automation happens faster than job creation  (short-term)


Universal Basic Income:
- shouldn’t be a blanket solution
- the future of children
- the big barrier the willingness to give away the money
